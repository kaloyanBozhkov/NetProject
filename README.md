<h1>NET CORE 3.0 PROJECT</h1>
<p>This was my part of a group project developped for a module at university.
<br/>
The main idea is that a central system (PrivateINet) can send commands to a device (ManufacturerDevice) on the ethernet physical layer (ISO/OSI). The central system is controlled through master commands sent as UDP packets through localhost. The fun part of this project was playing around with UDP packets going through a port on localhsot as well as sending Ethernet packets through a specific network interface controlled with the Pcap.Net library.
